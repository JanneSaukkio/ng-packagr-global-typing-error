# ng-packagr global typing error

This repository includes simple case where library modifies global `window` object by adding own `customProperty` variable to it. Doing this in regular Angular application doesn't raise errors with compilation but doing the same thing with ng-packagr causes compilation to fail.


## Error reproduction

Install required dependencies with: `yarn install`

Try to build the library with `yarn build`. Compilation should exit with the following error:

```
